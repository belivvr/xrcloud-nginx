# XRCLOUD-NGINX (English) | [한글](./README_ko.md)
* This project is a sub-project of the XRCLOUD (https://xrcloud.app) open source project by [BELIVVR](https://belivvr.com), which aimed to develop additional features by forking the [hubs](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation) project and provide Hubs' Room and Scene resources as a membership-based cloud service.
* XRCLOUD is a cloud service by BELIVVR that provides web metaverse resources through web dashboard and APIs.
* As of February 2025, BELIVVR has decided not to continue further development due to business challenges and has released it as open source (https://github.com/belivvr/xrcloud).
* This is a detailed documentation service for partners who have been provided with development services, and it aims to contribute to the web metaverse open-source ecosystem, albeit in a small way.
* Please note that we did not have the capacity to send separate PRs to HubsFoundation, and the XRCLOUD service has secured servers that can be operated until September 2025, but there are no confirmed plans for the service thereafter. Technical support will be provided to partners who have been promised service until December 2025.
* For further inquiries, please contact the former CEO of BELIVVR, Byungseok Yang (fstory97@gmail.com).
